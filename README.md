These configuration files are made and used for the Marlin-dev-2.1.x branch but I believe can work for bugfix as well.

Please use only as refrence as I've made many changes that are most definitely different from your printer. That said, please feel free to message me on reddit /u/SudoPush or hit me up on Discord(DeadTr33#6307) for any tips
